# 🚀 JS Journey Projects

Welcome to my personal JavaScript project lab 👨‍💻. This repo is my ongoing journey to learn JavaScript deeply by **building real-world projects**, one concept at a time. Each folder in this repo represents a mini-project or concept-focused build.

---

## 🧠 Why This Repo Exists

I learn best by doing. Every time I learn a new JavaScript concept—like closures, async/await, DOM manipulation, or fetch APIs—I build something useful (or at least fun) with it.

> "Code until it clicks."

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder includes:
- A standalone project
- README explaining the concept
- Live demo link (if hosted)
- What I learned
